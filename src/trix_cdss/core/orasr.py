"""ORASR: Operational Reasoning-Action Safety Routing.

This module implements the ORASR component of the TRI-X framework, which
translates DRAS-5 urgency classifications into operational routing decisions
with safety checks at each step.

ORASR Functions:
- Operational: Practical routing to available resources
- Reasoning: Logic-based decision making
- Action: Specific next steps
- Safety: Continuous safety verification
- Routing: Direct to appropriate care setting

ORASR ensures that DRAS-5 classifications result in appropriate,
safe, and feasible care pathways given real-world constraints.
