"""TRI-X Core Module: Triage-TiTrATE-XAI Framework Components.

This module contains the core components of the TRI-X framework for
clinical decision support in dizziness and vertigo diagnosis:

- Triage: ESI-based urgency assessment
- TiTrATE: Time-bound Risk-stratified Action with Treatment Escalation
- SRGL: Screening-First Risk Governance Logic
- DRAS-5: Decision Risk-Action States (5-level urgency classification)
- ORASR: Operational Reasoning-Action Safety Routing

These components work together to provide safe, efficient, and transparent
clinical decision support for acute dizziness presentations.
